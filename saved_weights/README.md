In this folder, you will find the pre-trained models for measuring the inhibition halo in images captured under a microscope. These models correspond to the YOLO neural networks used in the code, specifically YOLO_det and YOLO_seg. Additionally, the YOLO_seg model can be accessed via the following URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Bop9XG1e1z3DC_OuAdzIMxpX6Vgzvgv/view?usp=drive_link, which contains the segmentation weights required for precise analysis.
