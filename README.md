# Antibacterial-susceptibility-test-Resources-
Resources used for bacterial susceptibility testing with deep learning tools on images of bacteria under the microscope are organized as follows:

    * The Code folder contains the algorithm implemented for measuring the inhibition halo.
    * The Dataset folder includes the training and test images and the augmented images added to the training set for neural network training.
    * The Saved_Weights folder holds the YOLOv8 neural network weights, used for extracting the foreground and segmenting the regions of bacterial growth and bactericide in the visible area.
    * The Results folder contains all the outcomes of the bacterial susceptibility tests, including detailed analyses and visual representations of the inhibition halo measurements.
